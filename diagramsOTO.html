<h2>Organic subjectivity: saturation and reset</h2>

<p>Living individuals, collectives and ecosystems are characterised by processes of self-regulation in view of maintaining homeostasis in the face of fluctuations and change in the environment. This essentially conservative function of self-preservation has been foregrounded in cybernetics and linked with the idea of information as negation of entropy and robustness to noise, in other words: of unforeseen variation or of energy not available for work. The ‘porcupine diagram’ looks at the relation between self-regulation and change, whether confronting the individual, collective or ecosystem, or brought about by it. Here the tension is between, on the one hand, self-regulating mechanisms, aimed at maintaining a physiological, psycho-social or ecosyste- mic equilibrium, and the requirement of openness towards variation and change, ensuring what Ross Ashby called the “requisite variety” of possible responses to unforeseen changes. Funda- mental to it is the idea, developed by Henri Altan, of complexity on the basis of noise, which we will here interpret as a factor of resilience based on its relative incorporation: noise in terms of the potential for greater variety of possible responses to unforeseen changes or events. Atlan’s concept of “complexity on the basis of noise” was criticized by people like René Thom and more recently Rainer Zimmermann, and there is some dispute over its value within the NRU group.
However in this context it retains a heuristic value with regards to singular and collective dynamics navigating the tension between closure and openness, self-preservation and risk, if not: conservative and revolutionary impulses.
The circularity of the diagram, showing the porcupine opening and closing, does not aim to suggest a cyclicality that would annul history, as a rigid dialectical pendulum between revo- lution and counter-revolution, nor does it mean to imply a causal progression from openness to closure to openness, and so forth, indefinitely. If it is a pendulum, it is more like a double pendu- lum whose trajectory is unpredictable. Rather, the progression towards greater openness may simultaneously increase the pressure towards closure, understood here as an increased requi- rement for predictability and sameness, while the increasing closure or rigidity may increase the pressure towards openness. At stake here is the importance of understanding the dynamical progression between these conflicting needs as something that cannot be resolved once and for all, but that may be navigated in different ways. This is indicated by the bifurcation between closure as either a relatively compulsive catastrophic reaction, leading to an amplification of crisis, or as deliberate self-regulation and management of complexity, in the way for instance of ‘ritual’ practices. Closure and openness at their extreme constitute a kind of ouroboros, symbo- lised by the snake biting its tail. The pressure towards greater openness, likewise, may bifurcate or fluctuate between abrupt and uncontrolled change, fuelling chaos and with it the greater likelihood of a catastrophic reaction, or as a deliberate process with controlled variables, as for instance in artistic experimentation. In terms of the theory of knowledge one may usefully apply this diagram as representing the conflicting pressures of what Thomas Kuhn called normal scien- ce, aimed at the consolidation and axiomatic saturation of a given paradigm, and on the other hand, the scientific challenging of paradigms, which may invalidate a theory or lead to paradigm shifts. Taking a more speculative wide angle on anthropology, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s notions of territorialisation and deterritorialisation may fruitfully be thought within the dynamic of this diagram. Deleuze’s conception of difference and repetition, may further open another per- spective on colosure, if interpreted as repetition, as bearing difference within it, while openness, if associated with difference, could also be thought as entailing the repetition of difference.
On the other hand events requiring a novel response, associated with increased risk which, however, is still in the service of self-preservation—insofar as it satisfies the principle of “requisite variety” (Ashby) of possible responses—is an insurance policy against an unpredictably changing environment. The homeostatic function permeates the entire system, from its time- tested and most inflexible strata to the most flexible. Conversely the propensity for variation may permeate “downwards,” to varying degrees, affecting not only the most recent and most flexible strata of acquired responses, but potentially also more ancient and less flexible strata (Yağmur Denizhan). The porcupine is a humorous metaphor for the relevance of this apparent conflict of interest (resisting variation, seeking variation) for different scales of self-organisation. The hypothesis is that a rigid set of responses, when inadequate to changing circumstances, eventually provokes an impulse towards variation. The circularity in the diagram seeks to indicate that as the variation of possible responses increases, so does the risk of a reaction to perceived risk, in the form of a sudden reversal to rigidity and relative closure of a more narrow set of possible responses. At stake is the tension between the stabilizing power of established norms, and the creativity and risk involved in normativity as the power to revise existing norms and institute new ones.
The question this diagram raises is: to what extent do circular dynamics—of closure calling for variation and variation provoking closure—apply to the individual, the collective, and at which levels (physiological, psychological, sociopolitical, etc.)?</p>

<h2>Nihilism and contestation of/as noise</h2>

	<div class="container">
  <h1>
  <img src="NRU.2_2_contestation.jpg" width="1000px"/>
	</div></h1>

<p>In this diagram, noise is seen through the lens of the established association of noise with disruption and contestation. This diagram reinterprets noise in a set of relationships that ensue from the frictions created by power dynamics. Noise-as-nihilism and noise-as-contestation are considered in their different degrees of possible intensity, and in this diagram can be understood as phases or types:</p>
<h4>‘Phases’ of contestation:</h4>
<p>1) Noise of horror/novelty: affords the idea of dynamics between these polarities; </p>
	<p>2) Destructive noise: as the possibility/promise of pandemonium (“Dyonisiac noise”); </p>
	<p>3) Normalized noise: could leading to a type of nihilism/cynicism or reconciliation; </p>
	</>4) (Un)intentional noise: symptomatology of norms (e.g., farting).</p>
<h4>‘Types’ of nihilism:</h4>h4>
<p>1) Aggressivity/destruction: destructive noise, convergence towards pandemonium/ threshold of sense;</p>
<p>2) Complicity w/ ideology/established morality: e.g., normalized noise as acceptance;</p>
<p>3) Passive (hippie) ideology: e.g., normalized noise as disengagement;</p>
<p>4) Abandonment: lack of awareness and/or bordering on the threshold of sense.</p>
<p>Contestation and nihilism radiate towards and beyond the horizon of sense. This transcendence marks the collapse of the diagram, and the undoing/unsensing of the possibility of the very frictions that created the premises for contestation and nihilism in the first place. This is where pandemonium ensues. Evrim Bayındır, one of the authors of the diagram, says:</p>
<p>“‘Pandemonium’ is from Nietzsche’s ‘How the True World Finally Became a Fable’ in Twilight of the Idols where he speaks of the ‘pandemonium of all free spirits’, some sort of a celebration of the collapse of metaphysical dualities that have dominated the history of philosophy so far. It is only one page and written in fable form. The easiest way to think of pandemonium is perhaps to perceive it as a multiplicity that cannot be subsumed in unity since such a subsumption is the kind of metaphysical dualism that Nietzsche was criticizing in the fable. Pandemonium should also be understood as some kind of a social multiplicity, as it brings a community of free spirits. Nietzsche believes that metaphysics cannot be overcome without a social upheaval. But why does he use a sonic term to explain multiplicity? We know Nietzsche was a composer and wrote a lot about music, there must be a connection that is worth following. The German word he uses is Teufelslärm and the dictionary translates it as “hell sound,” which sounds even more interesting. Perhaps pandemonium as a sonic and social multiplicity is not a mere limit experience as in the general understanding of noise as chaos, but something that is produced after the end of metaphysical dualities such as models-copies, necessity-chance, unity- multiplicity, real world-apparent world, etc.”</p>

<h2>Collective Constructive Artificially Intelligent Noise Resilient Revolutionary Systems (CCAINRRS)</h2>

	<div class="container">
  <h1>
  <img src="NRU.2_4_ccairrns.jpg" width="1000px"/>
	</div></h1>

<p></p>This diagram links the dynamics of time, understood in terms of processes and processing, to the contemporary political situation.
We first understand the irreversible physics of time, described by thermodynamics, complexity theory, and more recently assembly theory, as a background condition for the understanding of dynamic processes, which constitute time through the historicity of their dynamics.
Emergent systems resist entropy over some finite time, not only through homeostatic self-maintenance but through radical transformation of the system itself, the environment, and the system-environment interaction. The latter can be represented as symmetry breaking transitions that alter the phase space of the modeled dynamics. The chaotic non- linear dynamics of interacting emergent systems creates a turbulent vortex of time(s).
The emergence of cognitive systems similarly leads to diverse forms of experienced temporalities, relative to the material conditions of cognitive processing and agent- environment interactions. We understand all cognitive systems as predictive systems, which act not only in relation to the linear and contingent unfolding of past causes and effects (reactive awareness), but also by acting on the future, and sculpting its possibilities.
Human social systems have, of course, massively transformed not only the environment, and the ways in which we interact with it, but also what it means to be human. This process suddenly accelerated about four hundred years ago with the emergence of capitalism, entering into a series of transitions by regenerative feedback processes that further accelerated the cascade of symmetry breaking events, more recently spurred by the development of computing (early 20th century) and internet technologies (late twentieth century).
At the previous NRU workshop in Porto (2021) we had conceived of the difference between noise in the 20th century and in the contemporary condition. This difference would be in terms of a shift in the image of thought and in the form of power, from a system based on robustness to noise and the statistical governance of a biopolitical mass through the maintenance of relatively fixed order parameters, to a system based on resilience to noise and the constant modulation of dividuals (Deleuze) through big data analysis, massive surveillance, and predictive AI modeling. We called these Predictive Artificially Intelligent Noise Resilient Systems (PAINRS).
The ‘vortex of emergent times’ is currently being managed by a number of big organisations, states and corporations whose interests are either geopolitical dominance or profit maximization. For most humans, and other animals, the current production of times leads only to further immiseration and extinction. We wondered if there could be any other future than this expanding destructive rampage, this pervasive capture and extraction of all nature in the drive for profit or domination. If profit has captured the future too, (how) can it be stolen back?
We thought the only possible way out of the current form of power, other than extinction, is the reappropriation of predictive AI technologies, so that they may be directed under common ownership towards revolutionary ends and the construction of new possibilities. We called these Collective Constructive Artificially Intelligent Noise Resilient Revolutionary Systems (CCAINRRS).</p>

<h2>Noise in diagramming</h2>


	<div class="container">
  <h1>
  <img src="NRU.2_5_tom" width="1000px"/>
	</div></h1>

<p>This diagram expresses the contradiction of diagramming noise: it is not only the very concept, but also the process of diagramming which is dynamic, unstable, and undetermined, while the outcomes (the “final” diagrams) are fixed and static. The desire for the collective process of diagramming noise to be amenable to the practices/concepts the diagrams intend to describe, is not amenable to the result they propose.
Our starting point for the creation of this diagram was five people and a sheet of paper; each took a corner (two people took one corner together), thereby acknowledging the set constraints of the four corners of a square sheet of paper. Each corner started tracing and unraveling what they perceived was being communicated by the other corners. In doing so, some expressed synesthetic interpretations, translating ‘oscillations’ and ‘vibes’ into lines and scribbles. Others attempted to diagram the power dynamics that emerged from the fact that while some talked and explained, others listened, while some understood, others were left wondering, etc.
Another corner took an alternative (metamodern) route to the supposed self-professed “transparency” of the exercise as it unfolded, taking the joke to a meta-level. This duo began an experiment in the abuse and encryption of noise. “TOM” became a running gag that most of the group had no access to, while at the same time: there was nothing to be “gotten”; “TOM” was also a very clear and simple message/word/term/recognizable name/etc. Making their gesture both banal and cryptic. And funny.
The repetition of this sign or symbol, which took over the diagram and went beyond the scope of paper’s surface, became a sort of noise, but also the most exemplary element of the phenomenon we were gravitating around: the very contradiction of diagramming noise.
Other elements unfolded (pun intended) as we played with the materiality of the paper and structured it into three-dimensional shapes, beyond its tacit two-dimensionality. During the presentation of the diagram, we also played with the fact that TOM went beyond the presentation and took on a performative role, transgressing the form of the presentation.
This meta-critique of the diagramming methodology retroactively affected/infested the previous diagrams, which is why you saw traces of TOM appearing in the previous diagrams.</p>

<h2>Music/noise in noise/music, a historical perspective</h2>


	<div class="container">
  <h1>
  <img src="music.png" width="1000px"/>
	</div></h1>

<p>This diagram attempts to depict the changing use and meaning of sonic noise in music across its historical development. It first of all acknowledges that there are diverse perspectives on this development depending on the understanding of musical culture that one has. The perspective that is depicted is effectively a Eurocentric one, and this is expressively alluded to by the shape of the diagram, which looks a bit like a Peters projection global map. It is a graph where the horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis refers to the conception and practical elaboration of what music and sonic noise means, or what it can do. From the Western hegemonic perspective that it takes there is a central European idea of music surrounded by various local traditions of musicking. From its inception to the late nineteenth century this is dominated by the organisation of pure tones according to time and key signatures and the effective exclusion or non- musicality of noise. Other musicking traditions do not necessarily exclude noise (this includes various folk traditions in Europe). At the turn of Western modernity there is a transformation of the idea of music resulting both from internal change (rise of bourgeois power, urban populations, alienation, and then the development of audio technologies) and from transcultural encounters with other local traditions of musicking (e.g. jazz, blues). The distinction between high and low musical forms becomes more pronounced, and there is a use of sonic noise in both. The idea of music expands but is still relatively circumscribed and beholden to the dominance of Western power and its inherited conception of musicality. As globalisation advances this idea of music continues to expand, again through transcultural encounters, audio technologies and changing social conditions. Postmodernity is characterised by a milieu of tolerant multiculturalism in which a diversity of musical traditions coexist or are brought into a zone of exchange and fusion, but it remains anchored to the inherited dominance of the Western mode. The modernist distinction between high and low music is to some degree overcome but there is a pervasive commodification of musicking and a loss of the impetus of formal innovation. Noise becomes an accepted aspect of musicality. On the one hand it is domesticated and loses the intrinsic critical power that drove its modern expression, on the other hand its use in a variety of avant garde and popular forms continues to enact social and musical transformations. We characterise the current development of that expansionary process as a move to transmodernity which has the power to unmoor itself from the Western hegemonic perspective of musicality, to galvanise formal innovation, and to catalyse critical uses of noise that further transform the idea of music and its current social conditions.</p>

<h2>PAINRS: Capitalist AI-capture</h2>


	<div class="container">
  <h1>
  <img src="PAINRS.png" width="1000px"/>
	</div></h1>
  
<p>Determining the specificity of noise in the 21st century requires laying out the historical processes that led up to it. What noise means was dramatically changed in the 20th century, not only with the development of computer science, information theory and cybernetics, but also in terms of the political and aesthetic upheavals occurring then. Information and computation technologies transformed and accelerated an already existing statistical form of social control which can be traced back to the onset of colo- nialism and capitalism several centuries before. Those 20th century technologies were based on the construction of systems that were robust to noise, i.e. that minimised or eliminated noise, and they accompanied or enacted an exclusionary form of power that regulated deviance from its normative framework or disciplined interference from its goals. Within this paradigm the generation of noise was a critical act, which can be seen in many different artistic practices, countercultures and political movements. Towards the latter part of the twentieth century there was a shift both in the form of power and its technical realisation. This shift can be characterised as one that mo- ves from centralised control systems that are robust to noise towards decentralised control systems that are resilient to noise. Noise is no longer external to the con- trol system but has become core to its operations. Rather than policing difference and noise they encourage it, they feed on it and smoothly regulate it. The distincti- ve features of this new neoliberal control system include: the financialization of all aspects of economic life, the collapse of centralised broadcast media into massively distributed information and communication networks (social media, user generated content, fake news, etc.) the development of machine learning (which departs from the classical form of early 20th century computing and enables a dynamic regime of constantly revised Bayesian probabilistic inductions on complex and qualitative data sets), and the pervasive application of these predictive AI tools to all aspects of social life in a massive program of surveillance and continuous flexible control. This diagram attempts to show the dynamics of agency and revolt under these new political conditions, which are dominated by what we call PAINRS: Predictive Artificially Intelligent Noise Resilient Systems. Google and Meta are of course PAINRS, but so are any relatively wealthy or technologically enabled states, corporations and insti- tutions. Agents are depicted according to the types of interaction and transformation they are undergoing, a key is shown at the top right. At the top left the multilevel dynamics of resistance, capture and transformation are shown, each of which emer- ge from or rely on the vibrational continuum between rhythm and noise. An agent is called a mutant if it is transforming its own conditions, this may be through expan- ding its horizons of sense and sensibility or engaging in new behaviours. Mutations may be the result or cause of noise relative to its internal or external milieu. Alliances between agents can give rise to symbionts. An agent whose transformative power is prodigious is called an ultra-mutant. It is highly noisy. Finally there are agents which we call shapeshifters because though they have the outward appearance of chan- ge they are complicit in the continued maintenance of the current horizons of sen- se and sensibility and the accompanying form of social power. PAINRS capture and feed on the noise produced by these agents, even or especially when that noise is critical of the system of power that the PAINRS preside over. Though noise is no lon- ger intrinsically critical under this paradigm there are still important critical uses of noise. Though most resistance is captured, resistance is not futile. There is no way back from PAINRS but that doesn’t mean there is no way forward. Mutants, symbionts, and ultramutants could completely transform their own conditions of agency.</p>
