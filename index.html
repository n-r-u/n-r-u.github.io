                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>You are about to enter a three-dimensional space that facilitates navigation through different sonic and media contexts from the perspective of a Deaf individual. </p>

                <h2>MOVEMENT</h2>
                <p>To navigate the three-dimensional space from your laptop follow these simple commands: Use your mouse or keyboard arrows to look around; use the keys W, A, S, D to move, and click on items to see pop up information about them.</p>

                <h2>INTERACTION</h2>
                <p>Each cloud is populated by selected items that exemplify objects or means of interaction. The user can navigate the different clouds to look for these objects, and click on them to learn more about what they represent. </p>

                <h2>APPROACH</h2>
                <p>The navigation experience is designed in a way that movement is hindered or enhanced according to the amount of noise, or friction, that the agent (the user) encounters in the different environments. For example: friction or noise increases (and navigation is slowed down) when the Deaf mode of existence encounters accessibility obstacles (for example, the assumption of spoken language as a universal modality of interaction).</p>

                <h2>EXPLAINATION</h2>
                <p>This experience is a proof of concept for a possibly more complex and more populated digital or hybrid environment. For the sake of simplification, the navigation is limited to four different contexts (in the shape of overlapping and intersecting clouds), spanning from Normative Sonic Space to the Space of Deaf Community. </p>

                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>This 3D space is a rendition of a 2D diagram produced by NRU exploring social and epistemic exclusion, using “noise” as a tool for decoding and interpreting the different interactions that happen between agents in different contexts of experience. You can learn more about it at this <a href="https://n-r-u.xyz/diagramsPorto.html" target="_blank">LINK.</a> </p>
                
                <p>The choice to render the 2D diagram into a 3D interactive space allows complex concepts to be exemplified by digital interactions that mediate the embodied experience of encountering friction in different contexts from a different perceptual perspective.</p>
                
                <p>The diagram could be applied to many different cases and examples. In this case, the 3D diagram is explained/exemplified through the “Deaf experience in a normative sonic world” to insert this sketch in the line of research that led from Martina Raponi’s “New Noises New Voices/NNNV” (2016 text, 2019-2020 transmedia interactive performance & sound works, 2021-2023 XR) to (a theory of the)“Unheard” (2023 text, 2024 interactive installation with Ymer Marinus).<br></p>
