<p>Living individuals, collectives and ecosystems are characterised by processes of self-regulation in view of maintaining homeostasis in the face of fluctuations and change in the environment. This essentially conservative function of self-preservation has been foregrounded in cybernetics and linked with the idea of information as negation of entropy and robustness to noise, in other words: of unforeseen variation or of energy not available for work. The ‘porcupine diagram’ looks at the relation between self-regulation and change, whether confronting the individual, collective or ecosystem, or brought about by it. Here the tension is between, on the one hand, self-regulating mechanisms, aimed at maintaining a physiological, psycho-social or ecosyste- mic equilibrium, and the requirement of openness towards variation and change, ensuring what Ross Ashby called the “requisite variety” of possible responses to unforeseen changes. Funda- mental to it is the idea, developed by Henri Altan, of complexity on the basis of noise, which we will here interpret as a factor of resilience based on its relative incorporation: noise in terms of the potential for greater variety of possible responses to unforeseen changes or events. Atlan’s concept of “complexity on the basis of noise” was criticized by people like René Thom and more recently Rainer Zimmermann, and there is some dispute over its value within the NRU group.
However in this context it retains a heuristic value with regards to singular and collective dynamics navigating the tension between closure and openness, self-preservation and risk, if not: conservative and revolutionary impulses.
The circularity of the diagram, showing the porcupine opening and closing, does not aim to suggest a cyclicality that would annul history, as a rigid dialectical pendulum between revo- lution and counter-revolution, nor does it mean to imply a causal progression from openness to closure to openness, and so forth, indefinitely. If it is a pendulum, it is more like a double pendu- lum whose trajectory is unpredictable. Rather, the progression towards greater openness may simultaneously increase the pressure towards closure, understood here as an increased requi- rement for predictability and sameness, while the increasing closure or rigidity may increase the pressure towards openness. At stake here is the importance of understanding the dynamical progression between these conflicting needs as something that cannot be resolved once and for all, but that may be navigated in different ways. This is indicated by the bifurcation between closure as either a relatively compulsive catastrophic reaction, leading to an amplification of crisis, or as deliberate self-regulation and management of complexity, in the way for instance of ‘ritual’ practices. Closure and openness at their extreme constitute a kind of ouroboros, symbo- lised by the snake biting its tail. The pressure towards greater openness, likewise, may bifurcate or fluctuate between abrupt and uncontrolled change, fuelling chaos and with it the greater likelihood of a catastrophic reaction, or as a deliberate process with controlled variables, as for instance in artistic experimentation. In terms of the theory of knowledge one may usefully apply this diagram as representing the conflicting pressures of what Thomas Kuhn called normal scien- ce, aimed at the consolidation and axiomatic saturation of a given paradigm, and on the other hand, the scientific challenging of paradigms, which may invalidate a theory or lead to paradigm shifts. Taking a more speculative wide angle on anthropology, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s notions of territorialisation and deterritorialisation may fruitfully be thought within the dynamic of this diagram. Deleuze’s conception of difference and repetition, may further open another per- spective on colosure, if interpreted as repetition, as bearing difference within it, while openness, if associated with difference, could also be thought as entailing the repetition of difference.
On the other hand events requiring a novel response, associated with increased risk which, however, is still in the service of self-preservation—insofar as it satisfies the principle of “requisite variety” (Ashby) of possible responses—is an insurance policy against an unpredictably changing environment. The homeostatic function permeates the entire system, from its time- tested and most inflexible strata to the most flexible. Conversely the propensity for variation may permeate “downwards,” to varying degrees, affecting not only the most recent and most flexible strata of acquired responses, but potentially also more ancient and less flexible strata (Yağmur Denizhan). The porcupine is a humorous metaphor for the relevance of this apparent conflict of interest (resisting variation, seeking variation) for different scales of self-organisation. The hypothesis is that a rigid set of responses, when inadequate to changing circumstances, eventually provokes an impulse towards variation. The circularity in the diagram seeks to indicate that as the variation of possible responses increases, so does the risk of a reaction to perceived risk, in the form of a sudden reversal to rigidity and relative closure of a more narrow set of possible responses. At stake is the tension between the stabilizing power of established norms, and the creativity and risk involved in normativity as the power to revise existing norms and institute new ones.
The question this diagram raises is: to what extent do circular dynamics—of closure calling for variation and variation provoking closure—apply to the individual, the collective, and at which levels (physiological, psychological, sociopolitical, etc.)?</p>
